sRNA Homolog Heatmap Generator
This project provides a workflow for visualizing the phylogenetic distribution of small RNA (sRNA) homologs. It consists of an R script to prepare the data and a Shiny web application to generate interactive heatmaps.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to take sRNA homolog data from multiple FASTA files (as produced by tools like GLASSgo), process this data to include taxonomic information, and then visualize the distribution of these homologs across different taxonomic levels in a heatmap.

Key Features
Data Preparation: The prepare_data.R script automates the process of extracting information from FASTA files and enriching it with taxonomic data.

Interactive Visualization: The Shiny app (app.R) provides a user-friendly interface to filter the data and customize the heatmap appearance.

Exportable Results: Both the generated heatmap (as a PDF) and the underlying data matrix (as a CSV) can be downloaded from the app.

Data Preparation (prepare_data.R)
This script is the first step in the workflow. It needs to be run once to process your raw data and create the heatdata.Rdata file required by the Shiny app.

Prerequisites
R: Make sure you have R installed.

taxonkit: This is a command-line tool required for fetching taxonomy data. It needs to be installed and accessible in your system's PATH. You can find installation instructions here.

Directory Structure: The script expects your FASTA files to be organized in a specific way. Each sRNA cluster should have its own directory, and inside that directory, there should be a _Network.fasta file containing the homolog sequences.

How to Run
Place the prepare_data.R script in the root of your project directory.

Ensure your FASTA files are organized as described above.

Run the script from your R console:

source("prepare_data.R")


The script will process the files and generate heatdata.Rdata and all_sRNAs.txt.

Shiny App (app.R)
The Shiny app provides an interactive interface for exploring the processed data.

Prerequisites
R and Shiny: You need R and the shiny package installed.

Required R Packages: Install the necessary packages by running this command in your R console:

install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "ComplexHeatmap", "colourpicker", "circlize"))


How to Run
Make sure the heatdata.Rdata file is in the same directory as app.R.

Open app.R in RStudio and click "Run App", or run the following command in your R console:

shiny::runApp("app.R")


This will launch the web application in your default browser.

Using the example.fa file
The example.fa file is a sample of the expected input format for the _Network.fasta files. It contains FASTA entries with headers that include the necessary metadata for the prepare_data.R script to parse. You can use this file to understand the required format for your own data.
